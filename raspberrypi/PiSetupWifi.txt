For security reasons, ssh is no longer enabled by default. To enable it you need to place an empty file named ssh (no extension) in the root of the boot disk.

From windows command prompt:
REM Switch to SD Card directory  (change disk name if needed)
E:
REM Create empty file called ssh
type NUL >> ssh

Create the file wpa_supplicant.conf in the root level. Add the wifi info

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NETWORK_NAME"
    psk="PASSWORD"
}

Take out the card and boot into the PI.
use default login

REM Clear out old pi reference then connect
ssh-keygen -R raspberrypi.local
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
(raspberry)

REM Change hostname and password, then permanenly enable ssh
sudo raspi-config
System->Hostname
System->Password
Interface->SSH

Still in raspi-config, optional but recommended
Localization->TimeZone
Advanced->Extend filesystem (allow system to use entire card which is good!)

Create new user so you don't have to use the pi user for everything (bad security)
Give good powers to the user as well
sudo adduser <username>
sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,input,netdev,gpio,i2c,spi <username>
Test that you can sudo 
sudo su - <username>

Disallow SSH for the PI user (security)
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
add line
DenyUsers pi

reboot
sudo reboot now
(May have to power cycle and wait here...)

when back, run updates
sudo apt-get update -y & sudo apt-get upgrade -y
